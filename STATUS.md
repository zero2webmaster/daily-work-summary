## 🧭 Decisions

### Decision: Use GitHub Actions (not local cron)
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** GitHub Actions provides free compute, automatic secret management, and built-in git access. No need to maintain a server or local machine running 24/7.

### Decision: Gmail SMTP via `dawidd6/action-send-mail`
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Battle-tested GitHub Action for email. Gmail App Passwords provide secure auth without OAuth complexity. Supports HTML formatting for rich summaries.

### Decision: Archive summaries in `summaries/` directory
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Git-committed markdown files provide a permanent, searchable history of daily work. Workflow auto-commits after each run.

### Decision: Raw `requests` for Airtable client (not `pyairtable`)
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Mirrors the PHP class pattern from z2w-ai-suite, avoids adding a new dependency (`requests` is already a transitive dep of PyGithub), gives full control over error handling and retry logic.

### Decision: IDs-only for Airtable references
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Using `appXXX`/`tblXXX` IDs instead of names means users can rename tables/bases in the Airtable UI without breaking the integration. Consistent with AGENTS.md best practices.

### Decision: `DELIVERY_METHOD` variable with `email` default
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Backward compatible — existing users see no change. Airtable is purely opt-in via setting the variable to `airtable` or `both`.

### Decision: Comma-separated DELIVERY_METHOD for Slack/Discord
**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Rationale:** Allows any combination of channels without combinatorial explosion of named values (e.g. `email,slack,discord`). The `both` alias is preserved for backward compat. Unknown values are warned-and-dropped rather than erroring, so adding new methods in future is non-breaking.

## ✅ Next Actions

1. Validate one live run with new repo-root markdown filename and email subject format
2. Configure Airtable: Create base, run `setup_airtable.py`, add secrets/variables
3. Test with `DELIVERY_METHOD=both` via manual workflow run
4. Test Slack delivery: add `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret, set `DELIVERY_METHOD=slack`
5. Test Discord delivery: add `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` secret, set `DELIVERY_METHOD=discord`
